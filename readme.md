# SortComplexity

Sorting algorithms:
`bubble sort`, `insertion sort`, `selectionSort`,
`merge sort`, `quick sort`.

The solution consist of projects:
* _SortLib_ - library containing sorting algorithms,
* _SortUnitTest_ - unit test for sorting algorithms,
* _SortApp - Application for checking the complexity of sorting algorithms.

## Task: SortComplexity
For each sorting algorithm:
* Measure the sorting time for several collection sizes,
* Draw a graph of the sorting time versus the collection size,
* What is the nature of the drawn relationship (unknown, constant, linear logarithmic, square)?
* Divide the algorithms into two groups:
  * slow,
  * fast.
